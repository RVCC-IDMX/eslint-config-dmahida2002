# Working it ESLint!

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The semi rule for ESLint is important because it enforces a consistent coding style and helps prevent syntax errors. In source control systems like Git and GitHub, multiple developers may be working on the same codebase, so having a standard coding style is crucial for ensuring that the code remains readable and maintainable. By requiring a semicolon at the end of each statement, the semi rule helps to reduce the likelihood of unexpected behavior caused by missing or improperly placed semicolons. Additionally, by automating this aspect of code quality, the semi rule saves developers time and effort and helps to promote collaboration and teamwork within a development team.
